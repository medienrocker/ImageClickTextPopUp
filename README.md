Simple Html, Css, JavaScript combo. A Gallery with some Pictures. They scale up on Mouse-over.
If you click on an Image, the coresponding (hidden) Text is displayed in a Textfield.

Originaly created for a "Text- und Medienfeld" in moodle. 
Helpfull practice: Create two "textbox" blocks in the right menu. 
  1. with the CSS code and
  2. for the JavaScript. 

User can use the Standard-Editor. Just DON'T add additional paragraphs (<p> tags). That will break the JS logic!
If you need to, go into "code-view" in the Editor and insert a <br> Breack Tag.

Have fun and build uppon.
